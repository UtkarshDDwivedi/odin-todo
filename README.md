# odin-todo

Finally completed the todo app, and I never in my dreams thought it was gonna be this difficult, but I am quite happy with the results.
This was a chance to practice everything I learned about OOP principles and SOLID, and I this was a part of why I fealt it was rather difficult as I think it would have been much easier with spaghetti code.
Also, another major hurdle was the local storage persistence, and boy was it tough.
Thanks for checking it out, have a great day!
